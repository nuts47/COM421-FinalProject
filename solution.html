            <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
            <p>We worked on making the homepage more user friendly by breaking down topics in general categories.
                We also added images for recent forums. </p>
               <p> The drop down menu will further display a search bar and suggestions. 
                When the user clicks on a certain category, they will be redirected to that category/service's page which will have all the topics Craigslist already shows on their homepage.</p>
                <p>This aims to alleviate the issue of crammyness and simplifies user experience.</p>
